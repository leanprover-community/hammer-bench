# TODO

## Self-test
- [ ] Generate expected test outputs for selftest (run against `hammer_measurements` tag and save to `tests/expected/`)
- [ ] Enable full selftest in CI (currently runs `--dry-run` only)

## Upstream
- [ ] Upstream Mathlib changes: `tryAtEachStepFromEnv` linter that reads tactic from `TRY_AT_EACH_STEP_TACTIC` environment variable
